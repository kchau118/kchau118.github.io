## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 4

I enjoyed doing Lab 4 because of how straight forward it was. It did take some time to figure out   formatting and some lines of code, but overall the lab was straight forward. When writing the code for the lab, the variables and values were clearly laid out.

* Lab 9

Lab 9 was one of my favorite labs, specifically part 2. Part 2 was one of my favorite labs because we got to create a guessing game. I thought it was really cool to execute the guessing game after completing all of the code.

* Lab 12

This was one of my favorite labs because it made me realize how much I've learned throughout the semester. Although it was an extremely challenging lab, I felt really successful when I was able to run the code without any errors. In addition to that, I thought it was really cool to see how I could create a gif.
